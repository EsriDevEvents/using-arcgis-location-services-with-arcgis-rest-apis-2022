## Environment variables

### Local environment

There are two sets of **local environment variables** (green box) which includes:
* Set of endpoints for ready-to-use services.
* Temporal variables used in workflows (like job_id for async operations).
* For Enterprise users we recommend to create a custom environment.

### Global environment

The Global set ("**Globals**"; yellow box) is used to set credential to generate short-lived access tokens: user and pass, client_id and secret.

### How variables are used

Local and Global variables are used in the requests definitions using `{{variable name}}`:

## Folder structure

There is a **Collection** (root folder) per each service:

### Collection structure

Each collection include documentation related with the service (service specs, APIs availables, etc)
![](./images/collection-doc.png)


And it also contains:

* **A folder for each operation** supported by the service (e.g. in Geocoding & Search: direct geocoding, reserve geocoding, batch geocoding, etc.).

* **A folder** with requests **to query service metadata, field structures, etc**.

### Operation folder structure

We are going to illustrate the structure using the "Find routes and directions" operation within the "**üöô Routing & Directions API**" as an example:
![](./images/operations-folder-structure.png)

This and other operations includes:

* **One or two "spec requests template**" with all the parameters described in the specification (`*-spec`). There will be one or two depending on whether the operation supports a direct/sync (‚û°Ô∏è) and a job/async (üîÑ) request or not. 

* A **"Examples"** folder with sample requests that matches the examples in the [Mapping APIs and locations services guides](https://developers.arcgis.com/documentation/mapping-apis-and-services/).

#### Spec request template

Each request in turn ( `operationName-spec`) includes:

* A short description, an image, and a link to the REST API doc and related guides in the developer guides.
* All accepted parameters (disabled by default), each with:
  * A short description (coming from the API reference). 
  * The value types that the operation support, using the value `<FieldName>` to referrers that it is a special JSON object with a given structure (more info in the REST API doc).

![](./images/operation-spec.png)

In addition to the query parameters, some requests also uses path variables. These can be identified because they uses a "colon" as a prefix (`:variableName`) as you can see in the following images:

![](./images/path-variables.png)

#### Examples folder

The structure of the directory depends on whether or not it supports async/jon requests or not:

* **If it only support sync/direct requests (‚û°Ô∏è)**: the folder will include some examples requests directly within the folder.
* **If it supports sync/direct (‚û°Ô∏è) but also async/job requests (üîÑ)**: the folder will contain folders for each type of request. The async/job will contain several numered requests (with a ‚úÖ) illustrating the usual workflow.

![](./images/sync-async-requests.png)

As you can notice, each example request includes a sample response:

![](./images/request-responses.png)
 
Another thing to note, is that to facilitate the execution of the asynchronous example requests, a code has been included in the "Test" tab which, after receiving the response that initiates the task (`submitJob`), it sets the `job_id` in the environment variables to allow the concatenation of the following requests:

![](./images/test-async-request.png)

#### Response visualization (BETA)

When using the Postman native app, some requests will include a visualization of the results, like shown in this direct geocoding request:

![](./images/geocoding-viz.png)

### Structures and definitions folder

And as mentioned before, in this folder we can find some useful requests that might be referenced from the other requests:
